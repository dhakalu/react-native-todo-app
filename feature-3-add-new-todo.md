# Create new TODO

In this branch we will add an option to create a new todo. For simpilicity, we will be adding a new todo to the state for now. Later we will be creating an api and storing that in some database.

To simplify the `TodoList` component we will move the logic of a singe todo item to a new component `Todo`.
