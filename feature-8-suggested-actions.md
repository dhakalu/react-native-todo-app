# Suggested Actions

## User Stories

* As a user, I would want to get suggested for possible actions that I might want to add as todo.

In this **[commit](https://github.com/dhakalu/react-native-todo-app/commit/8f7aa70a79648317264affb45701d3e6426b18af)*** we will be allowing user to choose some actions word instead of type them. For simplicity we will be mockingup the list of actions that get suggested under the file `data-mockup/actions.js`

I forgot to create the branch for this change/feature. So, I added commit changes that occured from `feature-7-*` branch
